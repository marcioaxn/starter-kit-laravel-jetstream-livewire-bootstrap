2026-01-06 10:00:00 - Session Resumed
- Investigated reported 'npm run build' crash.
- Ran 'npm run build' successfully.
- Checked recent file modifications; 'resources/js/app.js' and 'resources/scss/app.scss' were recently updated.
- Created this log file to track future interventions as per user protocol.
2026-01-06 10:15:00 - CSS Refactoring & Icon Analysis
- Refactored CSS: Moved inline styles from 'resources/views/layouts/partials/sidebar.blade.php' to 'resources/scss/app.scss'.
- Analyzed Bootstrap Icons: Confirmed 'bootstrap-icons' package is installed and imported in 'app.scss'.
- Build Verification: Ran 'npm run build', confirming 'bootstrap-icons' font files (.woff2, .woff) are correctly generated in 'public/build/assets'.
- Conclusion: Icons should render correctly as the assets are properly compiled and referenced.
2026-01-06 10:35:00 - Bootstrap Icons Fix
- Problem: User reported icons not appearing after hard refresh.
- Analysis: The import `@import "bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.css";` in `app.scss` might be causing path resolution issues with Vite/Sass.
- Action: Changed import to `@import "bootstrap-icons/font/bootstrap-icons.scss";` to leverage Sass compilation for better font path resolution.
2026-01-06 10:45:00 - Bootstrap Icons Font Path Fix
- Problem: Previous fix (switching to SCSS) was insufficient; Vite build warned about unresolved font paths.
- Analysis: The default relative path in `bootstrap-icons.scss` was not resolving correctly from `resources/scss/app.scss`.
- Action: Overrode `$bootstrap-icons-font-dir` in `resources/scss/app.scss` to explicitly point to `../../node_modules/bootstrap-icons/font/fonts`.
- Verification: `npm run build` now correctly generates `bootstrap-icons.woff` and `bootstrap-icons.woff2` in `public/build/assets/`.
2026-01-06 11:00:00 - Bootstrap Icons Strategy Change (JS Import)
- Problem: Previous fix failed on client side (paths/cache issues). User requested documentation of the recurring issue.
- Action: Created 'ai/BOOTSTRAP_ICONS_SAGA.md'.
- Strategy Change: Removed SCSS import entirely. Switched to importing CSS via JavaScript (`resources/js/app.js`).
- Rationale: Letting Vite handle the CSS import via JS ensures assets (fonts) are processed, hashed, and rewritten relative to the build root automatically, ignoring SCSS variable complexities.
- Verification: Build successful, fonts generated.
2026-01-06 11:15:00 - Bootstrap Icons Final Resolution (CDN)
- Problem: Persistent icon loading issues across environments despite local asset configuration fixes.
- Action: Reverted JS import changes. Implemented CDN (jsDelivr) directly in layout files (`app.blade.php`, `guest.blade.php`).
- Rationale: Suggestion by user. Eliminates build pipeline complexity and path resolution issues entirely. Pragmatic solution for stability.
- Documentation: Updated 'ai/BOOTSTRAP_ICONS_SAGA.md'.
2026-01-06 11:30:00 - Welcome Page Refactoring
- Problem: Welcome page (landing) had duplicated HTML structure and was missing the CDN fix, causing icons to fail there.
- Action: 
    1. Created `resources/views/layouts/public.blade.php` (and `PublicLayout` component) to serve as a clean, full-width layout with shared resources (CDN, Vite).
    2. Refactored `welcome.blade.php` to use `<x-public-layout>`, moving custom CSS/JS to `@stack` directives.
- Rationale: Eliminates code duplication (DRY), ensures all public pages inherit the correct asset configuration (including the CDN fix), and fixes the broken icons on the welcome page without breaking its specific design.
2026-01-06 11:50:00 - Git Branching and Detailed Commit
- Action: Created branch `en/fix/bootstrap-icons-loading-issue`, staged all related changes, and performed a detailed commit in English.
- Context: Consolidating Bootstrap Icons CDN fix and repository health documentation.
